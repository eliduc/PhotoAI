## üí´ Key Features
</p><p>
- <b>Unified Launcher</b>: Start all suite components from a single, user-friendly interface with smooth animations. [cite: 2]
</p><p>
- <b>Multi-Object Detection</b>: Automatically detects people (using <b>YOLOv8</b>) and dogs (using <b>Torchvision's Faster R-CNN</b>). [cite: 5, 11]
</p><p>
- <b>Face Recognition</b>: Recognizes faces using the <code>face_recognition</code> library, with options for fast (HOG) or accurate (CNN) models. [cite: 5, 11]
</p><p>
- <b>Dog Breed Classification</b>: Identifies dog breeds using a <b>DenseNet-121</b> model. [cite: 5, 11]
</p><p>
- <b>AI Description Generation</b>: Connects to <b>OpenAI (GPT-4o), Anthropic (Claude 3 Haiku), or Google (Gemini 1.5 Flash)</b> to generate short and long descriptions for your photos. [cite: 1]
</p><p>
- <b>Intelligent File Renaming</b>: Automatically renames photo files based on AI-generated descriptions. [cite: 1]
</p><p>
- <b>Comprehensive Database Tools</b>: Includes a DB viewer, a cleaner for merging duplicates, a face vector updater, and an ID generator for unknown entities. [cite: 3, 4, 10, 12]
</p><p>
- <b>Multilingual Support</b>: Most modules support English (EN), Russian (RU), and Italian (IT). [cite: 3, 4, 11]

## üõ†Ô∏è Suite Components
</p><p>
The toolkit is composed of several specialized applications, all accessible from the main launcher.
</p><p>
| Application | Filename | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <b>PhotoSuite Launcher</b> | <code>PhotoSuiteLauncher.py</code> | A modern, multilingual launchpad for all other utilities. [cite: 2] |
| <b>Face Detection</b> | <code>FaceDetection.py</code> | The core application for scanning photos, recognizing faces and dogs, and cataloging them in a database. [cite: 11] |
| <b>Face DB Viewer</b> | <code>FaceDBViewer.py</code> | A powerful tool to browse, search, and edit the recognition database. [cite: 12] |
| <b>AI Description Generator</b> | <code>AIPhotoDescriptionGenerator.py</code> | Generates photo descriptions using an LLM and renames files. [cite: 1] |
| <b>Face DB Cleaner</b> | <code>FaceDB_Cleaner.py</code> | Finds and merges duplicate people, dogs, and photos in the database. [cite: 3] |
| <b>Face Vector Updater</b> | <code>FaceVectorUpdater.py</code> | Analyzes, re-computes, and optimizes face vectors for better recognition accuracy. [cite: 4] |
| <b>NA to ID</b> | <code>NA-to-ID.py</code> | A utility to generate unique database entries for all unidentified detections. [cite: 10] |

## üöÄ Setup & Installation
</p><p>
1. <b>Clone the Repository</b>:
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repository-url]
   cd PhotoSuite
   ```
</p><p>
2. <b>Install Dependencies</b>:
   It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   * The <code>requirements.txt</code> should include: <code>Pillow</code>, <code>opencv-python</code>, <code>numpy</code>, <code>face_recognition</code>, <code>ultralytics</code>, <code>torch</code>, <code>torchvision</code>, <code>openai</code>, <code>anthropic</code>, <code>google-generativeai</code>, <code>imagehash</code>.
</p><p>
3. <b>Configure AI Services</b> (Optional):
   To use the <code>AIPhotoDescriptionGenerator</code>, create a file named <code>keys-ai.ini</code> in the root directory with your API keys: [cite: 1]
   ```ini
   [Keys]
   OpenAI = your_openai_api_key
   ANTHROPIC = your_anthropic_api_key
   GEMINI = your_google_gemini_api_key
   ```
</p><p>

## üéä How to Use
</p><p>
The entire suite is designed to be run from the central launcher.
</p><p>
1. <b>Start the Launcher</b>:
   ```bash
   python PhotoSuiteLauncher.py
   ```
    The launcher provides a modern, multilingual interface to access all the tools. [cite: 2]*
</p><p>
2. <b>Select a Module</b>:
   Click on any of the tiles to start the corresponding application. For example, click on <b>Photo Processing</b> to launch <code>FaceDetection.py</code>.
</p><p>
3. <b>Typical Workflow</b>:
   a. Use <b>Face Detection</b> to scan your photo directories and create/populate a <code>.db</code> database file.
   b. Use the <b>Face DB Viewer</b> to browse the results and manually correct any misidentifications.
   c. Run the <b>AI Description Generator</b> on the same database to add metadata and rename files.
   d. Periodically use the <b>Face DB Cleaner</b> and <b>Face Vector Updater</b> to maintain database health and improve recognition accuracy.
</p><p>

## üìí Database Schema
</p><p>
All tools in the suite operate on a shared <b>SQLite</b> database schema. When you run the <code>FaceDetection.py</code> module for the first time, it will prompt you to create a new database file. This file will contain several tables to store information about images, people, dogs, and their respective detections and encodings. [cite: 5, 11]
</p><p>
The key tables include:
- <code>images</code>: Stores metadata about each processed photo, including AI-generated descriptions. [cite: 1, 5, 11]
</p><p>
- <code>persons</code>: A catalog of all unique individuals (known and unknown). [cite: 5, 11]
</p><p>
- <code>dogs</code>: A catalog of all unique dogs. [cite: 5, 11]
</p><p>
- <code>person_detections</code> & <code>dog_detections</code>: Link tables that store the location (bounding box) of each detection within an image. [cite: 5, 11]
</p><p>
- <code>face_encodings</code>: Stores the 128-d face vectors used for recognizing individuals. [cite: 5, 11]
</p><p>
* The utilities automatically handle schema creation and updates (e.g., adding columns for AI descriptions). [cite: 1, 5, 11]*
